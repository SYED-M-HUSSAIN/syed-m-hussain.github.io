A critical task in the quickly developing field of robotics is efficient
path planning in dynamic environments. Within the framework
of ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), this paper gives a thorough
comparative analysis of several autonomous mobile robot path
planning algorithms, including A*, Dijkstra, Regulated Pure Pur-
suit (RPP), and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA). This research
investigated the effectiveness of merging local and global path
planners in a dynamic maze environment using an experimental
platform built on top of ROS2. Metrics include path length, deviation
from the planned trajectory, and execution time. Obtained results
demonstrate the performance of these algorithms highlighting their
strengths and limitations while focusing on how some combina-
tions perform better than others in terms of accuracy, planning
time, and reliability.
